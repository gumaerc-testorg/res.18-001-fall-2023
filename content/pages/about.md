The calculus courses at MIT are [*18.01 Single Variable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) and [*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/). Videos of those courses are on OpenCourseWare (OCW) along with lots of other useful materials. This site is about a completely separate calculus textbook by Gilbert Strang, and it will be helpful to viewers of OCW who would like to have online access to a textbook. 

Professor Strang's many contributions to OCW are mostly about linear algebra:

- [*18.06 Linear Algebra*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)*,* 
- [*18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/), and
- [*18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008/)

Each of those courses has a full set of video lectures recorded on the MIT campus. Those videos have been watched by millions of viewers around the world (especially *18.06 Linear Algebra*). Calculus and linear algebra are the two principal lead-ins to pure and applied mathematics.

Professor Strang's [*Highlights of Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/) course on OCW is a series of short videos. They focus on the main idea of the subject, involving two functions: function 2 is the "derivative" of function 1, and function 1 is the "integral" of function 2. If you are given one of those functions, then this calculus textbook and the *Highlights of Calculus* videos show how to derive the other function. The heart of calculus is to use those functions to solve real problems, as described in [*Lecture 1: Big Picture of Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/resources/big-picture-of-calculus/)*.*

Below, Professor Strang shares some thoughts on the history of the calculus textbook:

*For the textbook itself, its first printing was in 1991. That was a time of active "rethinking" of the course. I remember being in the audience at a discussion organized by the US National Science Foundation, about needed changes in typical calculus courses (to make them more relevant and interesting to students). Sitting at the back, I thought one necessary step would be a new textbook. That is the book you see here on OpenCourseWare, published by* [*Wellesley-Cambridge Press*](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/)*.*

*Chapter 0 of the book came in a later edition. Its purposes were to add more figures to illustrate the key ideas of calculus, and also to develop in a new way the most important function in this subject. That function is the exponential* \\(e^x\\)*. It has a very special feature, because it is both function 1 and function 2! In other words, the derivative of* \\(e^x\\)*is* \\(e^x\\)*, and the integral of* \\(e^x\\)*is* \\(e^x\\) *(plus any constant C). This becomes the most important function in many applications, including the enormous field of "differential equations" (because it solves the most fundamental differential equation dy/dx = y).*

*I hope the book and the exercises and the videos and even Chapter 0 will be useful to you! Best wishes in all your work.*
