The calculus courses at MIT are {{% resource_link "7b51b1e6-d5a3-4248-bf4f-250cd1beb767" "*18.01 Single Variable Calculus*" %}} and {{% resource_link "63066def-c27c-453c-9042-6bd4cd043915" "*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*" %}}. Videos of those courses are on OpenCourseWare (OCW) along with lots of other useful materials. This site is about a completely separate calculus textbook by Gilbert Strang, and it will be helpful to viewers of OCW who would like to have online access to a textbook. 

Professor Strang's many contributions to OCW are mostly about linear algebra:

- {{% resource_link "953471d3-d79d-4347-b1ea-5914230a7acc" "*18.06 Linear Algebra*" %}}*,* 
- {{% resource_link "719df9ba-11d8-4b31-b86d-b806430049bf" "*18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning*" %}}, and
- {{% resource_link "3f25bad5-94b4-4ba3-bbcb-1e0d9791fbc0" "*18.085 Computational Science and Engineering I*" %}}

Each of those courses has a full set of video lectures recorded on the MIT campus. Those videos have been watched by millions of viewers around the world (especially *18.06 Linear Algebra*). Calculus and linear algebra are the two principal lead-ins to pure and applied mathematics.

Professor Strang's {{% resource_link "c4e98dba-6847-4156-b945-04d45634c067" "*Highlights of Calculus*" %}} course on OCW is a series of short videos. They focus on the main idea of the subject, involving two functions: function 2 is the "derivative" of function 1, and function 1 is the "integral" of function 2. If you are given one of those functions, then this calculus textbook and the *Highlights of Calculus* videos show how to derive the other function. The heart of calculus is to use those functions to solve real problems, as described in {{% resource_link "00d320ab-b4ca-4b13-8522-17479f550a7a" "*Lecture 1: Big Picture of Calculus*" %}}*.*

Below, Professor Strang shares some thoughts on the history of the calculus textbook:

*For the textbook itself, its first printing was in 1991. That was a time of active "rethinking" of the course. I remember being in the audience at a discussion organized by the US National Science Foundation, about needed changes in typical calculus courses (to make them more relevant and interesting to students). Sitting at the back, I thought one necessary step would be a new textbook. That is the book you see here on OpenCourseWare, published by* {{% resource_link "bf73c453-9a4e-45fa-b3bc-673000197194" "*Wellesley-Cambridge Press*" %}}*.*

*Chapter 0 of the book came in a later edition. Its purposes were to add more figures to illustrate the key ideas of calculus, and also to develop in a new way the most important function in this subject. That function is the exponential* \\(e^x\\)*. It has a very special feature, because it is both function 1 and function 2! In other words, the derivative of* \\(e^x\\)*is* \\(e^x\\)*, and the integral of* \\(e^x\\)*is* \\(e^x\\) *(plus any constant C). This becomes the most important function in many applications, including the enormous field of "differential equations" (because it solves the most fundamental differential equation dy/dx = y).*

*I hope the book and the exercises and the videos and even Chapter 0 will be useful to you! Best wishes in all your work.*
